                  Selector is the label selector in string format to avoid introspection
                  by clients, and is used to provide the CRD-based integration for the
                  scale subresource and additional integrations for things like kubectl
                  describe.. The string will be in the same format as the query-param syntax.

                  that still have not been created.
